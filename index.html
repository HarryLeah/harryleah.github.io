							<h3>Hi there</h3>
							<p>
								I am a Structural Geologist at <a href="https://getech.com/">Getech</a> where I use varied techniques to explore potential for siting geothermal, CCUS, mineral extraction sites, and legacy petroleum reservoirs. 
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>
							After finishing my integrated Master's at The University of Manchester looking at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsg.2018.06.015">field analogues of faults hosting earthquakes in central Italy</a>, I moved to Cardiff University to do a PhD. 
							My PhD focused on shallow slow slip and plate interface deformation in subduction zones, my research chapters included using passive source seismology and data from the <a href="https://nz3dfwi.weebly.com/">NZ3D seismic experiment</a>, structural analysis of drill core from <a href="https://iodp.tamu.edu/scienceops/expeditions/hikurangi_subduction_margin.html">IODP Expedition 375</a>, field mapping and microstructural analysis of exhumed tectonic subduction mélange, and rheological modelling with a particular focus on the deformation of carbonates. 
							Slow slip is a kind of long-term earthquake (lasting weeks instead of minutes) which doesn't generate detectable seismic waves but is recorded as movement using GPS networks. 
							I particularly focused on the Hikurangi Margin subduction zone, offshore the North Island of New Zealand. 
							My PhD was supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=ROUfF-0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Åke Fagereng</a>, who also researches similar topics.

									<h4>The northern Hikurangi margin three-dimensional plate interface in New Zealand remains rough 100 km from the trench</h4>
									<p>
										In This work we mapped the Hikurangi margin plate interface using receiver functions from data collected by a dense 22 x 10 km array of 49 broadband seismometers. 
										Our mapped plate interface has kilometer-amplitude roughness we interpret as oceanic volcanics or seamounts, and is 1–4 km shallower than the regional-scale plate-interface model used in geodetic inversions.
										We show interface roughness also leads to shear-strength variability, where slip may nucleate in locally weak areas and propagate across areas of low shear-strength gradient.

									<h4>Inherited heterogeneities can control viscous subduction zone deformation of carbonates at seismogenic depths</h4>
									<p>
										This work links mineral-scale deformation mechanisms with structural evolution during subduction, providing examples showing how grain-scale heterogeneities facilitated viscous creep in calcite at nominally seismogenic temperatures.

									<h4>Heterogeneous subgreenschist deformation in an exhumed sediment-poor mélange</h4>
									<p>
										This work, published in <i>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</i> describes imbricated thrust faults on Llanddwyn Island, Anglesey, Wales, and details their field to microscale composition and structural fabrics. 
										We use this to model the rheology of the thrusts using flow laws and micro-mechanical models under variable conditions and show due to the heterogeneous composition of the thrust, slip partitions between the hangingwall and footwall under variable conditions.

									<h4>PhD Thesis: Mechanical evolution, fluid pressure generation, and shallow slow slip in subducton zones</h4>
									<p>
										My PhD thesis at <i>Cardiff University</i> comprised 3 main parts: 
										(1) Applying various seismological techniques to a large passive seismic array to produce high resolution 3D datasets, 
										(2) Microstructural and chemical analysis to investigate physiochemical deformation of sediments cored by ocean drilling offshore New Zealand, 
										(3) Field and microstructural analysis to investigate geological structures and rock mechanics processes in rocks deformed by subduction throughout Anglesey, Wales.

									<h4>AGU <i>Tectonics</i> paper on Mixed brittle and viscous strain localisation in pelagic sediments seaward of the Hikurangi margin, New Zealand</h4>
									<p>This first paper from my PhD describes how we studied stylolites and faults in the pelagic sediments seaward of the Hikurangi margin, New Zealand to determine the extent of pressure solution and brittle faulting, strain localisation and weakening, and deformation distribution. We then compare our results for stylolite-hosted strain from pressure solution to published models for pressure solution.</p>

									<h4>Coseismic extension recorded in the hangingwall of a thrust fault</h4>
									<p>My first paper, from my Master's project, describes structures showing extension localised within the hangingwall of the Vado di Ferruccio Thrust Fault, in the Central Apennines, Italy. After the first phase of thrusting, later extension has formed widespread mirror-surfaced faulting within dolostones in the hangingwall. Mirror surfaces indicate slip on these faults was seismic, and we show this activation of a hangingwall volume is comparable in orientation and distribution to seismic sequences observed at depth. <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Coseismic+extension+recorded+within+the+damage+zone+of+the+Vado+di+Ferruccio+Thrust+Fault%2C+Central+Apennines%2C+Italy&btnG=">Preprints are also available.</a> </p>
